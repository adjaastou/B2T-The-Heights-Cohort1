I have studied Marketing, and accounting. I have few years of administrative duties, customer service.
I like to start my own company one day and employs and lot of people and make their life better.
I need to learn to code in order to be literate(tech skills) in the future, and then possibly join the tech industry and create great things to make people lives better. Also  help in maintaining my businesses online.
